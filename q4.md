Interview question
==================


This is a very basic spring-boot app. Run it (using `mvn spring-boot:run`) or your favorite IDE.
Try the url `http://localhost:5000/greeting?name=David`, it should return the string: "Hello David".

You should use this template to develop a forum system.

# Background
https://restcountries.eu/ exposes some REST API about countries information.
Try the various API endpoints to search countries by name, etc.
For example:
https://restcountries.eu/rest/v2/all?fields=gini;name
returns
```json
[
{ "name": "Afghanistan", "gini": 27.8},
{"name": "Åland Islands"},
{"name": "Albania","gini": 34.5},
{"name": "Algeria","gini": 35.3},
{"name": "American Samoa"},
{"name": "Andorra"},
...
]
```

# Requirements
Consume data using the API listed in https://restcountries.eu/ an expose endpoints with the following requirements:

### GET http://localhost:5000/gini?name={country_name}
Should return a json with the following structure:
```json
{
    "Afghanistan":27.8,
    "Åland Islands":null,
    "Albania":34.5,
    ...
}
```
where key names are filtered based on `country_name` in the query parameter.

### GET http://localhost:5000/countries_with_currency/{currency}
Response should be an array with a list of country names which has this currency. For example `https://restcountries.eu/rest/v2/currency/eur?fields=name` should return:
```json
["Andorra","Greece",...]
```

## Guidelines
* Fork this repository and push your commits
* Use the spring-boot template given
* Write unit-tests, integration-tests
    * Write in javadocs what scenarios are in test
    * Higher coverage is better
* Write code documentation
* All classes given are meant to used as reference - once they are not needed, they can be removed.
* This project uses [lombok](https://projectlombok.org/) - use it when possible
* Use your preferred REST client to consume the API, spring has out of the box `RestTemplate` which can be used.
* Properly organize your project with `.gitignore` file, `readme` file explaining how to run the project, etc.

## Deliverables
* Send us a link to a repository fulfilling the requirements.
* Your code will be tested using different tests.
* Successful implementation will move to interview.
